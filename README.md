# Honeybee Integration Project

The purpose of this project is to teach users something new about honeybees. The project features a series of honeybee-themed mini-games and quizzes. The majority of the project is made of functions that are linked to each other to create a cohesive experience.<br />

What is the project?<br />
The project is intended for my COP 1500 class assignment that spanned across the 16-week semseter. The main purpose is to teach me how to use Python.

Who made it?<br />
The project was produced independently by me, Katarya Johnson-Williams, with periodic feedback from Student Assistants and Professor Vanselow. 

When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?<br />
I have been programming for a few years for fun, but this was my first serious programming project. I would consider myself a noivce programmer. I created the project between September 1st, 2020 to November 30th, 2020.

Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it relect you as a person?<br />
This assignment was created as an assignment for my COP 1500 class. It reflects me as a person because I have been a beekeeper for four years and I am very passionate about honeybees. Additionally, I am a starting the software engineering program at FGCU and I want to learn as much programming as possible.

Where did you make it? What school / class?<br />
I made the project on the FGCU campus. Class was virtual this semseter due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Documentation

Create a docs folder in your project. If using Java, generate JavaDoc in your IDE. If using C++, use Doxygen. Change repository settings (using Settings at top of page) to use GitHub Pages with your docs folder. Add a link to the javadoc/doxygen index.html file with this markdown: \[Text to appear]\(URL) <br />
The URL will be YourGitHubUserName.github.io/YourRepositoryName/foldername/filename<br /> 
Do not include the docs folder name in your URL. <br />
Sample: \[JavaDoc]\(https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html) <br /> <br />
[JavaDoc](https://pv-cop.github.io/PV-README-TEMPLATE/javadoc/index.html)

## Getting Started

Instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on someone's local machine for development and testing purposes.
<br />
Note for real project: You want to be able to share your project and enable collaboration. 
<br />
Note for school project: You want a potential client or hirer to be able to run your program. 

## Built With

* IDE used  
* Other software used  
* Resources used  
<br />Note for school project: Every section is an opportunity to make an impression. You could briefly add what you know about the IDE and describe your development skills. 

## Contributing

This section is more important for real projects but is good to include in school projects. <br />
One of the main purposes of GitHub and similar services is to provide a means for project collaboration. <br />
Tell someone how they can contribute to this project.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

This section would not necessarily be in a real README.  <br />
It is a reference for you and a place to impress potential employers with your knowledge. 
Identify what concepts you utilize so when you need to use them again you will know that you will find them here. Include a brief description of the concepts in your own words to help you prepare for related interview questions.
