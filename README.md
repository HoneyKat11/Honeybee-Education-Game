# Honeybee Integration Project

The purpose of this project is to teach users something new about honeybees. The project features a series of honeybee-themed mini-games and quizzes. The majority of the project is made of functions that are linked to each other to create a cohesive experience.<br />

What is the project?<br />
The project is intended for my COP 1500 class assignment that spanned across the 16-week semseter. The main purpose is to teach me how to use Python.

Who made it?<br />
The project was produced independently by me, Katarya Johnson-Williams, with periodic feedback from Student Assistants and Professor Vanselow. 

When did you make it? At what level of experience and proficiency were / are you?<br />
I have been programming for a few years for fun, but this was my first serious programming project. I would consider myself a noivce programmer. I created the project between September 1st, 2020 to November 30th, 2020.

Why did you make it? For fun? For an assignment? How does it reflect you as a person?<br />
This project was created as an assignment for my COP 1500 class. It reflects me as a person because I have been a beekeeper for four years and I am very passionate about honeybees. Additionally, I am a starting the software engineering program at FGCU and I want to learn as much programming as possible.

Where did you make it? What school / class?<br />
I made the project on the FGCU campus. Class was virtual this semseter due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
